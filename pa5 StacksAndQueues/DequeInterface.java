/**
 * A DequeInterface is a sequential structure with restricted access.
 *
 * Access is available only at the ends of the structure:
 * addFirst(E), E removeFirst(), and E peekFirst()
 * operate on the first element of the list;
 * addLast(E), E removeLast(), and E peekLast()
 * operate on the last element of the list.
 *
 * (A sequential structure which, like DequeInterface, permits access
 * and modification only at the ends is sometimes called a "deque",
 * pronounced "deck", which is short for "double-ended queue.")
 *
 * An implementation of DequeInterface must allow duplicate elements,
 * but must not permit null elements, since some of the methods
 * use null as a signaling return value.
 *
 * In addition to the methods required in the definition of this interface,
 * a class implementing this interface should provide a public constructor
 * with a single argument of type int, which specifies the initial
 * capacity of the DequeInterface.  The constructor should throw an
 * IllegalArgumentException if the specified capacity is negative.
